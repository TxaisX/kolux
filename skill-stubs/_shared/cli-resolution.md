## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- If the `KOLUX_CLI_COMMAND` environment variable is set, use its value. Kolux exports this
  for managed WSL sessions.
- Otherwise, in a dev checkout whose session exposes `KOLUX_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, use `kolux-dev`.
- Otherwise, on Linux outside a Kolux-managed terminal, use `kolux-ide`. Never run bare
  `kolux` there — outside Kolux's terminals it normally resolves to the
  GNOME Orca screen reader (`/usr/bin/orca`) and starts speech on the user's machine.
- Otherwise, use `kolux`.

Below, `KOLUX` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved. Substitute it before
running anything; do not create a shell variable or run `KOLUX` literally. This works the
same way in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

If the selected executable cannot run, report its exact error and stop. Do not fall through
to another executable, which could silently target a different Kolux build.

<!-- block: no-guessing -->

Prefer `--json`. Use the selected executable's `--help` for commands or flags the guide does
not cover. If a command reports that Kolux is not running, start it with `KOLUX open --json`
and retry. If `skills get` is unknown, explain that updating Kolux restores the guide; use
`--help` for read-only discovery and do not guess unsupported commands.
